#the Syntax is :
#for x in range(0,10,1)=> a start, stop, step
	#print(x)
	#by defaulf for will increase by 1(x,x,1), if you want to set by yourself you should change the '1' to another number

for x in range(0,12,2):
	print(x)

#for examples above, the x=x+1, so the 12 will not be called because if the x = '12', it will become 13 so there's no 12 on that example
#x is random variables
